## Main Components

### server
  A server is a computer (physical or virtual) located in a data center. It runs an operating system and server software. It responds to requests from users over the Internet.
### Role of the domain name:
The domain name (foobar.com) is a human-friendly address. The DNS translates it to an IP address so the browser can find the server.
### Type of DNS record:
The www in www.foobar.com is an A record. It maps the subdomain www to the IP address 8.8.8.8.
### Role of the web server:
The web server (Nginx) handles HTTP requests. It serves static content directly or passes dynamic requests to the application server.
### Role of the application server:
The application server runs the website’s backend code. It processes dynamic requests, interacts with the database, and returns the result to the web server.
### Role of the database:
The database (MySQL) stores and organizes the website’s data. The application server queries it when needed.
### How the server communicates:
The server communicates with the user’s computer over the Internet using the TCP/IP protocol.
### SPOF (Single Point of Failure):
There is only one server. If it fails, the whole website goes down.
### Downtime for maintenance:
Updating code or restarting the web server means the site will be temporarily unavailable.
### Cannot scale:
If many users visit at the same time, one server might not handle the load and the site could become slow or stop working.
